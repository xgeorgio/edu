<b>SILCA: Simple Internal Lights Calculator in C.</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>Programming example in ANSI C for calculating the basic illumination setup parameters for interior lights. The program is a simplified variant of the professional engineering suites that calculate the proper intensity and layout of illumination elements for every room in a house or office. However, the data and formulas implemented are real and they can be used in practice for simple installations. The program illustrates the proper use of nested iteration loops and I/O streams.</p>
