<b>DNAerrors: Code-theoretic examination of the Universal Genetic Code</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This is a small experimental analysis of the coding properties of the Universal Genetic Code. The aim is to investigate its robustness, specifically the error resilience of amino-acid decoding, i.e., the effects of any 1/2/3-base mutations in a codon. The 4-base symbols define a full space of 64 different codon expressions, but in practice only 20 amino-acids and 1 stop symbol are implemented. Thus, there is much redundancy in the code, at various levels for each used codon. This small test also estimates the robustness in terms of correct decoding given a specific probability of single-base mutation. See '/examples' folder for a test run output.</p>
