Title:<br/>
<b>Mini-SQL: Example RDBMS for local-file database in C.</b>

Description:<br/>
This small program implements an example SQL-like query handler and local file manager, including all in-memory table manipulations. It was developed with mid-90s compilers, so small changes to the sources may be necessary in  order to compile successfully with modern C compilers.
