<b>Func-root: Function root and minimum finding in C.</b>

Description:<br/>
This small program implements 'vanilla' versions of the Newton-Raphson and Bisection algorithms for root-finding, as well as Bisection algorithm for function minimization. For proper target functions (continuous, smooth), they should successfully finish in O(logN) steps, where N is roughly the required granularity (Xmax-Xmin)/Xeps of the search within the search range.
