<b>B.I.P. - Basic Image Processor</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>B.I.P. stands for 'Basic Image Processor' and it is a tutorial application for image processing. It implements basic algorithms for 8-bit grayscale bitmap images, including histogram functions (equalization, normalization), edge detection (standard, robert, sobel and generic 3x3 differential mask), sharpening (standard, robert, sobel and generic 3x3 differential mask) and thresholding (manual, optimal).</p>
<p>Input images must be OS/2 type bitmaps and all processed images can be saved in the same format too. The program has been implemented in Delphi/Pascal as an SDI application, so only one image can be active at any time.</p>
<p>The program was developed as part of an MSc semester project (1999) in the Informatics Department, University of Athens, Greece. For compatibility reasons, all menu commands and program messages are in English, but all documentation and references are in Greek (see 'doc' folder).</p>
