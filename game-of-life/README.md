Title:<br/>
<b>Game-of-Life in Pascal.</b>

Description:<br/>
John Conway's "Game of Life" is perhaps the most popular simulation of cellular automata. This program was implemented back in '93 in Turbo Pascal 3.0 (DOS). With a few minor modifications, namely removing screen manipulation primitives, it should be able to compile with any modern Pascal compiler.
